# How Authentication is Implemented

1. User Login Request
   - **Initiation**: The user initiates the authentication process by sending a login request. This request typically includes the user's credentials, such as a username and password.
   - **Server Reception**: The server receives the login request and processes the provided credentials.
2. Server and Database Interaction

   - **Credential Verification**: The server interacts with the database to verify the user's credentials. The database contains user information, including stored passwords, often hashed for security.
   - **Database Query**: The server queries the database to check if the provided credentials match any stored user credentials.

3. Authentication Verification

   - **Success Response**: If the credentials are correct, the server responds with a success status (e.g., HTTP 200) and proceeds to set up a session for the authenticated user.
   - **Error Response**: If the credentials are incorrect, the server responds with an error (e.g., HTTP 401 Unauthorized).

4. Session Management

   - **Session Creation**: Upon successful authentication, the server creates a session to store the authenticated user's information. The session is stored on the server and includes details indicating that the user is authenticated.
   - **Cookie Assignment**: The server sends a cookie back to the user's browser. This cookie contains the session ID, a unique identifier that links the user's browser to the corresponding session stored on the server.

5. Subsequent Requests

   - **Resource Request**: For subsequent requests to restricted resources, the user's browser includes the session ID cookie.
   - **Session Retrieval**: The server uses the session ID from the cookie to retrieve the session information and verify the user's authentication status.

6. Access Control
   - **Access Granted**: If the session indicates that the user is authenticated, the server allows access to the restricted resources.
   - **Access Denied**: If the session does not indicate authentication, the server denies access to the restricted resources.

## Summary

- **Initial Login**:
  - User sends login request.
  - Server verifies credentials via database.
  - Server creates a session.
  - Server sends a session ID cookie to the user.
- **Subsequent Requests**:
  - User requests restricted resources.
  - Browser sends session ID cookie.
  - Server retrieves session.
  - Server verifies authentication status.
  - Server grants or denies access based on session information.

## Key Points

- **Cookies**: Store the session ID on the client-side browser, identifying the session.
- **Sessions**: Store authenticated user information on the server-side, ensuring secure and persistent user state across requests.
- **Server-Database Interaction**: Essential for verifying credentials during the login process.
- **Security**: Ensures sensitive user data (like passwords) are not exposed on the client side, maintaining secure authentication.

This approach ensures that user authentication is secure, efficient, and persistent across multiple interactions within the web application.
