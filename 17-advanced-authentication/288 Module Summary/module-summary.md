# Module Summary: Password Resetting and Authorization

## Password Resetting

1. **Implementation Security**:

   - Password resetting must be implemented securely to prevent unauthorized users from resetting passwords of random user accounts. This involves ensuring that only the legitimate user who requested a password reset can perform the action.

2. **Reset Tokens**:
   - **Random**: Reset tokens must be generated in a truly random manner. This ensures that they cannot be predicted or guessed by an attacker.
   - **Unguessable**: The tokens should be complex enough to be unguessable, typically involving a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - **Unique**: Each reset token should be unique. Even if multiple users request password resets at the same time, their tokens should be distinct.

## Authorization

1. **Importance in Applications**:

   - Authorization is a critical aspect of almost every application. It involves defining what authenticated users are allowed to do within the application. While authentication verifies user identity, authorization determines their permissions and access levels.

2. **Granular Access Control**:

   - Not every authenticated user should have unrestricted access to all parts of the application. Different users might have different roles and permissions based on their needs and responsibilities.

3. **Permission Restrictions**:
   - To implement effective authorization, access must be restricted by assigning specific permissions to different user roles. This approach helps in locking down access to sensitive parts of the application and ensures that users can only perform actions they are authorized for.

## Key Points

Password Resetting

- Ensure secure implementation to prevent unauthorized resets.
- Generate reset tokens that are random, unguessable, and unique.

Authorization

- Crucial for controlling user access in applications.
- Differentiate user roles and restrict permissions accordingly.

## Implementation Tips

### For Password Resetting

1. **Token Generation**:

   - Use libraries that provide secure random token generation, such as `crypto` in Node.js.
   - Example in Node.js:

     ```javascript
     const crypto = require("crypto");
     const token = crypto.randomBytes(32).toString("hex");
     ```

2. **Token Storage**:

   - Store the reset token securely in the database along with an expiration time.
   - Ensure that the token is hashed before storing to prevent misuse if the database is compromised.

3. **Token Validation**:

   - When a user attempts to reset their password, validate the token against the stored hash and ensure it has not expired.
   - Example validation:

     ```javascript
     const isValidToken =
       storedHash === hashFunction(providedToken) &&
       Date.now() < tokenExpiration;
     ```

### For Authorization

1. **Define Roles and Permissions**:

   - Clearly define user roles (e.g., admin, user, guest) and their respective permissions.
   - Example role definition:

     ```javascript
     const roles = {
       admin: ["create", "read", "update", "delete"],
       user: ["read", "update"],
       guest: ["read"],
     };
     ```

2. **Middleware for Access Control**:

   - Implement middleware functions to check user permissions before allowing access to routes.
   - Example middleware in Express.js:

     ```javascript
     function authorize(role) {
       return (req, res, next) => {
         if (!req.user || !roles[req.user.role].includes(role)) {
           return res.status(403).send("Access denied.");
         }
         next();
       };
     }
     ```

3. **Use Secure Session Management**:
   - Ensure that user sessions are managed securely to prevent session hijacking and unauthorized access.

By adhering to these principles and implementation tips, developers can ensure secure password resetting mechanisms and robust authorization controls within their applications.
