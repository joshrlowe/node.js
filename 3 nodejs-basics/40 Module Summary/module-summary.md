# Module Summary

## How the Web Works

- Client => Request => Server => Response => Client

## Program Lifecycle & Event Loop

- Node.js runs non-blocking JS code and uses an event-driven code ("Event Loop") for running your logic.
- A Node program exits as soon as there is no more work to do.
- Note: The `createServer()` event never finishes by default.

## Node.js & Core Modules

- Node.js ships with multiple core modules (`http`, `fs`, `path`, ...).
- Core modules can be imported into any file to be used there.
- Import via `require('module')`.

## The Node Module System

- Import via `require('./path-to-file')` for custom files or `require('module')` for core & third-party modules.
- Export via `module.exports` or just `exports` (for multiple exports).

## Asynchronous Code

- JS code is non-blocking.
- Use callbacks and events => Order changes!

## Requests & Responses

- Parse request data in chunks (Streams & Buffers).
- Avoid "double responses".
